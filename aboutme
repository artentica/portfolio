Hello! My name is Vincent Riouallon, I'm a French student and I am currently studying in a school of engineering science called ISEN, and particulary love Software Engineering.

I discover informatic before my academic training and began with small websites and a discover of C language. I feeled good so I continue and more I learn more I enjoy. Now I have various skills in software or website and more thanks to my others activites.
I made, make, and will make many others informatics projects, in Web by example I made a pluggin for Jquerry (you can see the page here).

I go to several local meetings: The Google Developers Group (GDG)
								Java User Group (FinistJUG)

I also participated at events like: The Startup Week-end in Brest in 2015 as part of the filming crew
									The Glass Camp Bank in 2014 where we win with our prototype of google glass application: ISIS (you can see here)
									The Startup Week-end in Brest in 2014 as a participant

I am currently member of two clubs in my school: IT Club and Cinema Club where I am the treasurer of both. I also take bass lessons to the Music Club. And out of school I am also a member of the Rotaract Brest.
These activities require me to organize myself well and always push my limits. But that's how I work and it suits me perfectly.

With my activities and my Part-time internship in Crédit Mutuel Arkéaa (French bank) I have learn how work in crew and work in cohesion. During my part-time internship (that I am doing) I develop script For a monitoring platform (Web app) for analyse the comportment of servers in the data center. I am also doing some PIG and Hadoop to calculate other usefull information.

You can contact me by email.

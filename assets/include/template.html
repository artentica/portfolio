	<p>Wood workers are known for their eye for detail and passion for the projects they create. Jet worked with Kaber to insure the new line of Jet wood lathes carried that same level of care and detail. The new family includes table top lathes up to the larger freestanding lathes and needed to carry the family look across the entire product range. The first products in the updated line to launch have been the 1015 and 1221 bench top lathes, both of which have been well received in the market place.</p>
